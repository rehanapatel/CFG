Hello, I am just a girl who adores coffee.

... No seriously, I do.

I wake up and I think "Coffee"
I used to have a coffee machine in my bedroom at university. 
I like coffee so much, I have written a haiku about it:

Ahem...

I want nothing but,
coffee in my big ol' cup,
brain cells yell, "What's Up?"

You're welcome.
