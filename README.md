# Welcome to My GitHub Repository! 

In this repository I hope to carry out multiple CFG Degree Assignments including Assignment 1! This **README** will contain a comprehensive tutorial on the following git commands/practises (in no particular order):

- git status
- git add
- git checkout
- git branch
- git commit
- adding files to branches
- pull requests
- merges

In this repository are the example files I've used for the tutorial and a folder of images that you'll seecrop up in the *README* :)
