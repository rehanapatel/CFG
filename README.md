## About Me

I'm a graduate physcist and MASSIVE coffee lover, hoping to become a coding wizard and break into the world of technology! I also tutor on the side and so have set the assignment up as if I am creating a tutorial for my students (or myself as I can be forgetful). 

Yes my love for coffee is in fact essential and useful information about me.

## The Purpose of This Repository and README File

In this repository I hope to carry out multiple CFG Degree Assignments including Assignment 1! This *README* is for **Assignment 1** and will contain a comprehensive tutorial on the following git commands/practises (in no particular order):

- git status
- git add
- git checkout
- git branch
- git commit
- adding files to branches
- pull requests
- merges

In this repository are the example files I've used for the tutorial and a folder of images that you'll seecrop up in the *README* :). This tutorial assumes you've already created a remote repository and linked itto a local repository on your local machine (laptop, PC). Happy Coding!
